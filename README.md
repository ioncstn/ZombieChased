# ZombieChased

  In this game you are playing as a gangster that is shooting zombies. Simple as that ðŸ˜Ž.
  I created this game in order to broaden my programming skills by learning a new language to me, Rust, and to experience the steps of programming a video game.

# How to make it run

- clone this git repository
- go into the src/main.rs file and edit the first code with the second one:

```rust
  .resources_dir_name(whatever_is_here_now)
```

```rust
  .resources_dir_name(the_absolute_path_of_the_/resources_directory)
```

- run 'cargo run --release'
- enjoy

# How to play

- WASD for moving
- SPACE for shooting
- MOUSE for aiming
- P for pausing / unpausing
- 1 and 2 for buying / switching between weapons while in pause
